# NVIM Live Server

A simple HTTP server with live reload for HTML, CSS, JS files written in **just lua**.

> [!WARNING]  
> This plugin is experimental! It works for simple use-cases but might break with more complex ones!

## Features:

- Extremely light (Less than 500 lines of code!)
- No dependencies (Aside NVIM ofc)
- Blazingly fast 🚀 (Starts and serves in less than milisecond!)
- Start or Stop server by a single click from status bar.
- Automatic free port detection

## Installation

### Lazy:

```lua
{
  "hyperstown/nvim-live-server",
  cmd = { "LiveServerStart", "LiveServerStop", "LiveServerToggle"},
  lazy = false,
  opts = {
    host = "127.0.0.1" -- optional, default 0.0.0.0
    port = 5550, -- optional, default 8080
    bind_attempts = 3, -- optional, default 2
  },
},
```

### Manual

```lua
require('live-server').setup(opts)
```

## Usage:

You can either start the server with `LiveServerStart` or `LiveServerToggle`,
for stopping is either `LiveServerStop` or `LiveServerToggle`.

You can also click the icon on status bar to toggle the server.

## Integration with status line

### NvChad

```lua
M.ui = {
  statusline = {
    modules = {
	  live_server = require("live-server.statusline.nvchad").render
    },
    order = { "mode", "file", "git", "%=", "lsp_msg", "live_server", "diagnostics", "lsp", "cwd" } -- "live_server" is our live server module here
  }
}
```

### AstroNVIM

```lua
return {
  "rebelot/heirline.nvim",
  opts = function(_, opts)
    local status = require("astroui.status")
    opts.statusline = { -- statusline
      hl = { fg = "fg", bg = "bg" },
      status.component.mode(),
      status.component.git_branch(),
      status.component.file_info(),
      status.component.git_diff(),
      status.component.diagnostics(),
      status.component.fill(),
      status.component.cmd_info(),
      status.component.fill(),
      status.component.lsp(),
      status.component.virtual_env(),
      -- here we put our live-server module
      status.component.builder({
        { provider = require('live-server.statusline.astronvim').live_server_provider },
      }),
      status.component.treesitter(),
      status.component.nav(),
      status.component.mode()
    }
  end,
}
```

## How it works?

This server makes use of
[SSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events)
instead of relying on websockets. So theres no need for implementing
whole websockets spec. SEE events are way less sophisticated than webstockets but are way more than enough for live reload server. \
HTTP server was implemented using `vim.uv.new_tcp()`. It's a very simple implementation of HTTP and it should be used only for development.


## Automatic free port detection

Server will automatically try different ports if default port specified in config is currently busy.
By default it will try default port + current attempt no. With last attempt (max attempts specified in config with `bind_attempts`) it
will ask system to pick a random free port. If that also fails server will give up.
If you want to skip predictable port checking and ask system right away to give you a random free port just set `bind_attempts` to 1.

## Why?

I found a few plugins that already provide Live Server functionality
even with realtime edits but for me every package was either too complex or it depended on some npm package or it was no longer maintained.

## Planned features

- Seamless CSS reload
- Directory browser
- Improved code injection
- Healthcheck
